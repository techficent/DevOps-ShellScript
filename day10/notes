#debug a shell script

If your script is not producing expected output or gives
an issue in output, use debug


1) Validate a script for syntax
run script with -n option (noexec)
It shows blank output if there is no error
If there are errors, they are printed on the screen

2) identify unset variables
run script with -u option (unbound variable)
It shows a statement if an unbound variable is found
It executes statements till an unbound variables if found and stops on the line 
with variable error

3) use xtrace option

	a) use in script directly with -x & +x
		use it if you want to trace only a specific part of your code	
	b) use with bash as bash -x <script name>
		use it if you want to trace whole program

4) use file descriptor for xtrace

	create a file descriptor using BASH_XTRACEFD in the script
	use it to copy xtrace output to a file

5) execute some activity before every command in the script

	use trap 'commands' DEBUG

Note: pstree and sctrace command!
